## Quicksheets

This is a set of cheat and quick sheets to remind me of a bunch of stuffs I use occasionally - this is by no mean intented to be a full description of functions and/or operations done, rather a help for the things I found useful. It's there on the open because why not! some other people may find this useful too.
